# DCSD_LIGHTS
A simple project to light up the LEDs on the Apple DCSD cable arbitrarily.
The project is based on Mathieu Hautebas' DCSD_STATUS available on https://github.com/matteyeux/dcsd_status

The DCSD cable is a factory cable used most likely for testing at Foxconn for the Apple devices. The cable features a gray box with 3 LEDs labeled "Busy", "Pass" and "Fail". Orange, Red and Yellow when lit. Some extensive research has been carried out by `lululombard`. His research can be found on <a href "https://github.com/lululombard/DCSD-reverse-engineering"> DCSD reverse engineering </a>

The cable registers itself as an FTDI device
